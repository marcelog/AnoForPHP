NOTICE
======
This patch is made for PHP 5.3.5, but it should be easy to port it to other 5.3.+ versions.

INSTALL
=======
1.- Download the patch.
2.- Apply with:  patch -p1 < anophp-5.3.5.diff
3.- Compile and install PHP as usual.

HOWTO
=====
The annotation token is "@@", because the "@" was already taken. So for instance, you would do:

@@AnAnnotation
@@AnotherAnnotation
...
class something {
...
}

also:

class something {
	@@AnAnnotation
	@@AnotherAnnotation
	...
	public function aMethod() {
		...
	}
}

And, best of all:
class something {
	public function aMethod(@@AnAnnotation $a, @@An1 @@An2 $b) {
		...
	}
}
