ABOUT
======
First things first, this patch is made for PHP 5.3.5, but it should be easy to port it to other 5.3.+ versions.

Now, the idea behind this patch is pretty obvious. Annotations are a very popular thing and php lacks of them. Also, it's pretty expensive to have them inside doc blocks (i.e: /** */), so this patch is made mostly for the extension reflection of php and the ZendEngine2(tm).

The annotation token is "@@", because the "@" was already taken. So for instance, you would do:

@@AnAnnotation
@@AnotherAnnotation
...
class something {
...
}

also:

class something {
	@@AnAnnotation
	@@AnotherAnnotation
	...
	public function aMethod() {
		...
	}
}

And, best of all:
class something {
	public function aMethod(@@AnAnnotation $a, @@An1 @@An2 $b) {
		...
	}
}
